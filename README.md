ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Winnie!
ðŸŽ“ Rising Senior at Northeastern University, studying Computer Science and Business Administration with a concentration in Supply Chain Management
ðŸ”­ Aspiring Software developer Enthusiast while utilizing my business skills 


I love diving into all aspects of Computer Scienceâ€”from building algorithms and designing user interfaces to experimenting with data-driven modelsâ€”so that I can discover what truly excites me. I am big on continuously learning and building my skills, and I believe taking initiative is key to growth. Over the past year, I was honored to join the Break Through Tech program, where I immersed myself in hands-on machine learning and data science coursework, collaborated with peers on real-world challenges, and refined my ability to translate research insights into practical solutions. In Fall 2025, I completed a project developing an AI-powered chatbot that could cut response times by nearly 70%, which made me become more curious in AI. Iâ€™m eager to bring this blend of curiosity, technical skill, and collaborative experience to a professional environment where I can both contribute to impactful projects and continue learning from industry professionals.

âœ¨ Fun Fact:
I can speak three languages and learning a fourth one. Can you guess which ones? Also, coffee used to make me fall asleep, so I was not a fan, but I now can't go a month without a latte.
