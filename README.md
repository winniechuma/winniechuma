ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Winnie!
ðŸŽ“ Rising Senior at Northeastern University, studying Computer Science and Business Administration with a concentration in Supply Chain Management
ðŸ”­ Aspiring Software developer Enthusiast while utilizing my business skills 

I love Computer Science and very open to trying to every aspect of it before decidind on what interest me more. I will list them more throughly down below, but I have worked on a game project, a jou7rnal kind project, AI related project, and databases related projects. I thought I wasn't into projects requiring alot of data reading and collecting, but as someone who is big on continuously learning and building my skills, I believe taking initiative is key to growth. A year ago, I was accepted into the Break Through Tech program, and I completed it this last Spring of 2025. I focused on building machine learning models and dived deeper into data science. Iâ€™m looking to leverage and grow my skills in a professional setting where I can contribute to exciting projects and learn from industry professionals.

âœ¨ Fun Fact:
I can speak three languages and learning a fourth one. Can you guess which ones? Also, coffee used to make me fall asleep, so I was not a fan, but I now can't go a month without a latte.
